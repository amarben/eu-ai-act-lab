## Slide 1: Welcome Message

### Slide Title
"Welcome to EU AI Act Implementation: Transform Theory into Practice"

### Slide Notes (Instructor Narration - 340 words)

Welcome to this comprehensive course on implementing the European Union's Artificial Intelligence Act in your organization. I'm genuinely excited to guide you through this transformative journey where we'll bridge the critical gap between regulatory theory and practical, audit-ready compliance. My name is [Instructor Name], and I've spent years helping organizations navigate complex regulatory frameworks and turn abstract requirements into concrete, implementable processes. The EU AI Act represents one of the most significant regulatory developments for artificial intelligence in history, and understanding how to implement it effectively is no longer optional—it's absolutely essential for any organization that develops or deploys AI systems within the European Union market.

What makes this course fundamentally different from typical compliance training is our intensely practical, deliverable-focused approach. We're not going to spend endless hours discussing legal interpretations or debating theoretical scenarios. Instead, we're going to roll up our sleeves and actually build the compliance documentation that regulators expect to see. Throughout these twelve focused lectures, you'll gain hands-on experience with the EU AI Act Implementation Lab, a sophisticated web-based application that transforms abstract regulatory requirements into concrete, actionable workflows. This isn't a simulation or educational toy—it's a professional compliance tool powered by Google Gemini AI that generates audit-quality documentation, manages evidence, tracks progress, and produces professional reports.

Here's what you're going to accomplish: you'll create nine professional compliance deliverables including risk classification reports, gap assessment analyses, AI governance frameworks, comprehensive technical documentation meeting Article 11 standards, risk management registers, training compliance plans, incident management protocols, and executive compliance summaries. Every single document will be generated using professional templates with AI assistance, then customized by you for realistic scenarios. By the end of this course, you'll have a complete compliance package that demonstrates your ability to implement EU AI Act requirements professionally and systematically. This portfolio could be presented to auditors, shared with executive leadership, or used as the foundation for your organization's actual compliance program. Whether you're a compliance officer, AI developer, product manager, risk manager, or business leader, this course will equip you with immediately applicable skills. Let's begin this important work together.

### Bullet Points

- Professional web application powered by Gemini AI
- Risk reports, gap assessments, governance frameworks, technical files
- Generate real compliance packages ready for regulatory review
- Build actual documentation for your organization
- Learn from practical regulatory implementation experience
- Skills translate directly to real-world compliance work

## Slide 2: Learning Objectives

### Slide Title
"What You'll Master: SMART Learning Outcomes"

### Slide Notes (Instructor Narration - 335 words)

Let's be absolutely clear about what you'll accomplish in this course by establishing specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound learning objectives. By the completion of this training, you won't just understand the EU AI Act theoretically—you'll have demonstrated your ability to implement it practically through hands-on exercises, deliverable creation, and real-world application. These aren't vague aspirations; they're concrete skills you'll prove you've mastered by producing professional compliance documentation.

First, you'll master the ability to systematically identify and inventory AI systems within an organization according to EU AI Act definitions and scope criteria. This means you'll be able to distinguish between AI systems and traditional software applications, categorize different types of AI technologies using regulatory definitions, document them using professional templates, and maintain accurate inventories. You'll practice this skill by building a complete AI system inventory using the Implementation Lab's structured tools.

Second, you'll develop expertise in risk classification using the EU AI Act's four-tier framework: unacceptable risk, high-risk, limited risk, and minimal risk. Through guided exercises with decision trees and regulatory criteria, you'll classify various AI systems, understand the specific compliance obligations attached to each risk category, justify your classification decisions using Article references, and generate professional risk classification reports. This systematic methodology is exactly what compliance auditors use when evaluating organizational compliance.

Third, you'll create comprehensive technical documentation that meets the demanding requirements of Article 11 for high-risk AI systems. This includes mastering all eight required sections covering intended purpose, data governance, privacy impact assessment, training procedures, testing and validation, quality assurance, monitoring systems, and human oversight mechanisms. You'll use the lab's AI-powered documentation generator to create professional-quality technical files, learning when to accept AI recommendations and when to customize content for specific contexts.

Fourth, you'll build complete AI governance frameworks including oversight structures, role definitions, policy documents, risk management processes, training programs, and incident response protocols. Each module culminates in a specific deliverable that builds toward your final compliance package. These aren't theoretical exercises—they're practical skills that demonstrate professional competence in EU AI Act implementation.

### Bullet Points

- Catalog organizational AI using regulatory definitions
- Classify systems into four-tier risk framework with justification
- Build comprehensive technical files for high-risk AI systems
- Establish organizational structures, roles, policies, and accountability mechanisms
- Design risk assessment, mitigation, and monitoring processes
- Produce audit-ready documentation using AI-powered tools
- Create role-based training and qualification tracking systems
- Design detection, reporting, investigation, and resolution workflows

## Slide 3: Course Outline

### Slide Title
"Your Learning Path: 10 Modules from Foundation to Mastery"

### Slide Notes (Instructor Narration - 345 words)

Let me walk you through exactly how this course is structured to maximize your learning effectiveness and ensure you develop practical compliance skills progressively and systematically. We've organized the content into ten core modules, each carefully designed to build upon the previous one, taking you from foundational understanding through advanced implementation capabilities. This isn't a random collection of topics—it's a deliberately sequenced learning path that mirrors how organizations actually implement EU AI Act compliance in real-world practice.

We begin with Module 1, Understanding the EU AI Act, where we establish the essential regulatory foundation. You'll learn the Act's scope and territorial application, key definitions of AI systems and providers, the risk-based regulatory approach, enforcement mechanisms and penalties, and your specific obligations as an AI system provider or deployer. This foundational knowledge is critical for everything that follows. From there, Module 2 focuses on AI System Identification, teaching you how to inventory existing AI systems in your organization and assess whether they fall under the regulation's scope.

Module 3 tackles Risk Classification, which is arguably the most critical decision point in your compliance journey because it determines all subsequent obligations. We'll work extensively through the four risk categories using real-world examples and practice scenarios. Module 4 covers Gap Assessment, where you'll evaluate your current practices against EU AI Act requirements and develop prioritized remediation plans.

Modules 5 through 9 dive deep into building your actual compliance infrastructure. In Module 5, you'll establish AI Governance frameworks with oversight committees, roles, and policies. Module 6 covers Risk Management systems including risk identification, assessment, and mitigation. Module 7 focuses on Technical Documentation, where you'll create the comprehensive Article 11 documentation package. Module 8 addresses Training Programs and organizational competence. Module 9 handles Incident Management including detection, reporting, and resolution.

Finally, Module 10 brings everything together with Continuous Monitoring and Reporting, teaching you to maintain compliance over time through dashboards, performance metrics, regular audits, and regulatory reporting. The course concludes with a capstone project where you'll compile all your deliverables into a complete, integrated compliance package—exactly what you'd present to regulatory authorities during an audit or conformity assessment.
